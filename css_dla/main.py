"""
This module contains the model of the city using the DLA mechanism.

The model is represented by a grid of size w*h, where each cell can be either empty or contain a city.
The model is initialized with a single city at the center of the grid, or with two cities at the center of each half of the grid.
The model is updated by spawning a particle at a random point on the edge of a circle with a radius that grows logarithmically as a function of structure size.
The particle then moves randomly until it encounters an established structure.
The particle then becomes a city and the process repeats.
The model can be run for a given number of iterations using the loop method.
